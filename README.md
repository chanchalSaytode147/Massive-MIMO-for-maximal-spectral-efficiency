# Massive-MIMO-for-maximal-spectral-efficiency
Massive MIMO is a promising technique to increase
the spectral efficiency (SE) of cellular networks, by deploying
antenna arrays with hundreds or thousands of active elements at
the base stations and performing coherent transceiver
processing. A common rule-of-thumb is that these systems should
have an order of magnitude more antennas, M, than scheduled
users, K, because the users’ channels are likely to be
near-orthogonal when M/K > 10.

The BS in each cell is equipped with an array
of M antennas and communicates with K single
antenna UEs at the time, out of a set of Kmax UEs.

We consider three propagation environments with
different severity of inter-cell interference:
● Average case: Averaging over uniform UE
locations in all cells.
● Best case: All UEs in other cells are at the
cell edge furthest from BS j.
● Worst case: All UEs in other cells are at the
cell edge closest to BS j.
